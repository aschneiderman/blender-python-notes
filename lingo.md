## Overview
> The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, materials and lights

## Geeky Terms

### Material

The manual says
> *Materials control the appearance* of meshes, curves, volumes and other objects. They define the **substance** that the object is made of, its **color** and **texture**, and how **light** interacts with it.
(Emphasis mine)

> Materials are data-blocks that can be assigned to one or more objects, and different materials can be assigned to different parts of meshes.

> Materials consist of three shaders, defining the appearance of the surface, the volume inside the object, and the displacement of the surface.

> Surface Shader:  The surface shader controls the textures and light interaction at the surface of the mesh

### Mesh

I can’t find a good definition of a mesh. The standard one is:
> A mesh is a collection of vertices, edges, and faces that describe the shape of a 3D object
> 
> Mesh Modeling typically begins with a Mesh Primitive shape (e.g. circle, cube, cylinder…). From there you might begin editing to create a larger, more complex shape.
